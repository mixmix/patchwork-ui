Phoenix v1
==========

![phoenix](phoenix.png) **It's distributed!**

Phoenix is the web UI for [scuttlebot](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot) and part of the [secure-scuttlebutt](https://github.com/ssbc/secure-scuttlebutt) decentralized network. 

Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB) is a fully-decentralized data network designed to replace Web services. It uses cryptographic keypairs to gossip unforgeable data-feeds across the network. "Pub" servers aggregate and redistribute the feeds, but SSB has no central authority: every node is equal, and the network is fully open.

Join us in #scuttlebutt on freenode.

## Getting Started

Follow the instructions for using [scuttlebot](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebot). Phoenix comes packaged with scuttlebot by default.

## Building

To build phoenix, run `npm run build`. If you're doing active development, run `sbot server` with the `--dev` flag. This will cause the frontend assets to be built on each request.
